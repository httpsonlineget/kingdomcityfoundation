            <h3>Education & Scholarships</h3>
            <p>
              🎓 Education & Scholarships At Kingdom City Foundation, we believe
              that education is the key to breaking the cycle of poverty and
              building a brighter, more sustainable future for every child. Many
              orphans and underprivileged children have dreams of becoming
              doctors, engineers, teachers, and community leaders — but without
              access to quality education, those dreams are often cut short.
              That’s why our Education & Scholarships Program is at the heart of
              our mission. Through the generous support of our donors and
              partners, we provide financial aid, school supplies, uniforms, and
              mentorship opportunities to children who would otherwise be unable
              to attend school.

            <h3>Residential Care</h3>
            <p>
              🏠 Residential Care At Kingdom City Foundation, we believe that
              every child deserves a safe, loving, and nurturing place to call
              home. Our Residential Care Program provides shelter, protection,
              and holistic support for orphaned, abandoned, and vulnerable
              children who have nowhere else to turn.Our residential homes are
              more than shelters — they are families. Each child is seen, heard,
              and loved. We strive to create an atmosphere of belonging, where
              children can dream, learn, and thrive just like every other child
              deserves.

            <h3>Health & Nutrition</h3>
            <p>
              🩺 Health & Nutrition At Kingdom City Foundation, we recognize
              that good health and proper nutrition are the foundation of a
              child’s growth, learning, and overall well-being. Many orphans and
              vulnerable families in our communities face malnutrition and
              limited access to healthcare — challenges that can hinder a
              child’s ability to thrive. Our Health & Nutrition Program is
              dedicated to ensuring that every child and family we serve enjoys
              a healthy, balanced life. You can help build healthier communities
              by: Donating food, medical supplies, or hygiene kits. Sponsoring a
              feeding or medical outreach program. Partnering with us to expand
              access to clean water and healthcare. Together, we can make health
              and nourishment a reality for every child and family — because a
              healthy life is a hopeful life.

            <p>
              💼 Skills & Livelihoods At Kingdom City Foundation, we understand
              that empowering individuals with practical skills is one of the
              most effective ways to fight poverty and create lasting change.
              Our Skills & Livelihoods Program is designed to equip orphans,
              widows, and vulnerable youths with the knowledge, tools, and
              confidence they need to become self-reliant and financially
              independent.

              support to underprivileged families, orphaned children, and
              vulnerable individuals in urban and rural communities. Food &
              Clothing Drives: We organize regular distributions of food,

              environmental cleanliness through periodic clean-up initiatives.

              in need. Emergency Relief Response: During crises such as floods,
